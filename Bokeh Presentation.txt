 Intro

We're going to focus on the basics of matplotlib
and Bokeh and what are it's uses


MatplotLib

Cretaed By John Hunter in 2002. Forms foundation for
other plotting libraries like seaborn.
Was created orginally as a patch to IPython
to enable MatLab-style plotting.
Most important featues are it's ability to 
play well with many OS and graphic backends.


Go over the examples.

Importing the modules. requires numpy as well
to create points.

Basic plotting 
np.linspace-->Used to create numeric sequences
syntax (start,stop,how many points in b/w)


Style-->adds support for customizing properties
for our graphs. Fonts,labels,colors, bg as well.

The most famous one is ggplot (pre-defined style)
This can be found in R as well (gplot2)
ggplot2----> Otiginally created as a package for 
data visualization in R, by Hadley Wickham in 2005
Some other related plots are Plotly and as we discussed,
ggplot for python
some other plots are given


You can even define your own style as well.


HISTOGRAM VS BAR GRAPH

Histogram is representation of frequency for numerical
data., while bar graphs are used to plot different categories 
of data

Histogram--->quantitative data
bar graph---> Categorical data

hence histograms have bins, to seperate the quantities.
One more thing to notice is that hists-->dont have spaces
while bars have. (explain this)

Colors--> explanation of sequential & diverging palettes


Pie plots.
Disadvantages,
any dimensions greater than 5 elements looks bad and is
hard to differentiate.
This plot can represent only one data-set. Bar & Histograms
provide you this liberty to compare categories.
Making decisions on visual impact can lead to inaccurate
results and conclusions.



Javascript1- frontend part--stylesheet,css

<div> --> div_bokeh,js_bokeh

Utility.py ---> calls the function of boxplot div_bokeh,js_bokeh,
                cdn_js,cdn_css, returns the .html part

BoxPlotFunction link---> returns the javascript functions 
                         that will be called later on
